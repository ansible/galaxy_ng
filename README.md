# Galaxy NG

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ansible/galaxy_ng.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ansible/galaxy_ng)

A Pulp plugin to support hosting your very own Ansible Galaxy server.

This is a brand new take on Ansible Galaxy, so it will look and feel a bit different than the current [galaxy.ansible.com web site](https://galaxy.ansible.com). Over time we expect to migrate the web site to this codebase, so for now you're looking into the future, and you have an opportunity to help shape that future.

Our mission is to help organizations share Ansible automation and promote a culture of collaboration around Ansible automation development. We'll be providing features that make it easy to create, discover, use and distribute Ansible automation content.

To see what we're currently working on, [view the Roadmap](/ROADMAP.rst).

## Installation

The following is a simple quickstart for installing a local Galaxy server. It requires that you have [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) installed.

1. Clone the Pulp Installer project:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pulp/pulp_installer.git
    ```

2. Set your working directory to the `pulp_installer` directory.

3. Create a playbook called `install.yml` that contains the following:

    * **Warning**: please change the `pulp_default_admin_password`  (Initial password for the Pulp admin).

    ```
    - hosts: all
      vars:
        pulp_settings:
          secret_key: secret
          content_origin: "http://{{ ansible_fqdn }}"
        pulp_default_admin_password: password
        pulp_install_plugins:
          pulp-ansible: {}
          galaxy-ng: {}
          pulp-container: {}
      roles:
        - pulp-database
        - pulp-workers
        - pulp-resource-manager
        - pulp-webserver
        - pulp-content
      environment:
        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pulpcore.app.settings
    ```

4. Install any Ansible role dependencies required by the Pulp installer. Execute the following command to download roles from [Community Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com):

    ``` 
    $ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
    ```

5. Run the `install.yml` playbook

   The following provides an example of how to start playbook execution. It assumes an inventory file called `hosts` exists in the current directory and contains the target host(s) where Galaxy server is to be installed: 

    ``` 
    $ ansible-playbook install.yml -i hosts
    ```
