# Galaxy NG

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng/actions/workflows/ci-docker-compose-integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng/actions/workflows/ci-docker-compose-integration.yml)

A Pulp plugin to support hosting your very own Ansible Galaxy server.

This is a brand new take on Ansible Galaxy, so it will look and feel a bit different than the current [galaxy.ansible.com web site](https://galaxy.ansible.com). Over time we expect to migrate the web site to this codebase, so for now you're looking into the future, and you have an opportunity to help shape that future.

Our mission is to help organizations share Ansible automation and promote a culture of collaboration around Ansible automation development. We'll be providing features that make it easy to create, discover, use and distribute Ansible automation content.
