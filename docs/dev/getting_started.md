# Getting Started

## Setting up the developer environment

### Docker Compose

> **TO BE DEFINED**

### OCI Env

This is the new preferred way to develop with pulp. It provides a flexible, containerized environment that's easy to set up. It supports running integration and functional tests as well as developing the UI. It supports all the features from the docker and vagrant environments, but isn't as heavily tested as the docker environment.

## Issue Tracker

Issues for Galaxy NG are tracked in Jira at https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AAH. Issues labeled with [quickfix](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AAH-1202?jql=project%20%3D%20AAH%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20quickfix%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC) are a good place for beginners to get started.

## Submitting a Pull Request

UI PRs should be submitted at [github.com/ansible/ansible-hub-ui](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-hub-ui).

When submitting a PR to either the UI or backend:

- All PRs must include either `Issue: AAH-XXXX` or `No-Issue` in the commit message. 

    - `No-Issue` should be used infrequently and the reviewers may ask you to create a Jira ticket and attach it to your PR.
    - `Issue: AAH-XXXX` should must include a Jira ticket number (such as AAH-123). This also requires a changelog entry in `CHANGES/`. Changelog entries follow the `<issue_number>.type` format. For example if I submit a fix for AAH-123, it must also come with a `CHANGES/123.bugfix` entry. Changelog file extensions include:

        - `.feature`: use this for new features. New features must include documentation. See our [docs documentation](writing_docs.md) for more information.
        - `.bugfix`: use this for bugfixes.
        - `.misc`: use this for small maintenance changes that don't need to be communicated such as fixing typos, refactoring code etc.

PRs for the backend also require:

- All commits must be signed. [How to set up commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
- Any changes to the app require updates to the tests in `galaxy_ng/tests/`. This can include adding new tests or updating existing tests to cover changes. See [dev/writing_tests] for more information.
PRs will be reviewed by two members of the team.
