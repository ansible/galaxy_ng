# Getting Started

## Setting up the developer environment

### Docker Compose environment

This is recommended for beginners. It's less error prone and easier to setup, however it offers less flexibility than vagrant. Use this if you're:

- primarily developing the UI
- primarily contributing to galaxy_ng and not pulpcore, pulp_ansible or pulp_container
- need to develop a feature for console.redhat.com
- need to test keycloak or LDAP authentication
- are developing using a Mac
- writing documentation

[Docker environment developer setup guide](/galaxy_ng/dev/docker_environment).

### OCI Env

This is the new preferred way to develop with pulp. It provides a flexible, containerized environment that's easy to set up. It supports running integration and functional tests as well as developing the UI. It supports all the features from the docker and vagrant environments, but isn't as heavily tested as the docker environment.

### Vagrant Environment

This uses the [Pulp developer environment](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/contributing/index.html) which is based off of vagrant. It offers a developer environment that is much closer to a production installation of Galaxy NG. It allows users to run on a wide variety of operating systems with any set of pulp plugins installed. Use this if you're:

- contributing to one of the pulp projects
- need to debug an issue that's presenting itself in production installations
- need to run pulpcore and pulp_ansible without the galaxy_ng plugin installed
- need to debug an issue on an operating system other than RHEL/Centos

## Issue Tracker

Issues for Galaxy NG are tracked in Jira at https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AAH. Issues labeled with [quickfix](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/AAH-1202?jql=project%20%3D%20AAH%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20quickfix%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20updated%20DESC) are a good place for beginners to get started.

## Submitting a Pull Request

UI PRs should be submitted at (github.com/ansible/ansible-hub-ui)[https://github.com/ansible/ansible-hub-ui].

When submitting a PR to either the UI or backend:

- All PRs must include either `Issue: AAH-XXXX` or `No-Issue` in the commit message. 

    - `No-Issue` should be used infrequently and the reviewers may ask you to create a Jira ticket and attach it to your PR.
    - `Issue: AAH-XXXX` should must include a Jira ticket number (such as AAH-123). This also requires a changelog entry in `CHANGES/`. Changelog entries follow the `<issue_number>.type` format. For example if I submit a fix for AAH-123, it must also come with a `CHANGES/123.bugfix` entry. Changelog file extensions include:

        - `.feature`: use this for new features. New features must include documentation. See our [docs documentation](dev/writing_docs.md) for mor information.
        - `.bugfix`: use this for bugfixes.
        - `.misc`: use this for small maintenance changes that don't need to be communicated such as fixing typos, refactoring code etc.

PRs for the backend also require:

- All commits must be signed. [How to set up commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
- Any changes to the app require updates to the tests in `galaxy_ng/tests/`. This can include adding new tests or updating existing tests to cover changes. See [dev/writing_tests] for more information.
PRs will be reviewed by two members of the team.
