# Context

GalaxyNG is the next generation of the codebase behind https://galaxy.ansible.com. We hope to meld this code
in a way that makes it suitable for both the customers of the Ansible Automation Platform and the community
around https://galaxy.ansible.com.


# History


# Future

We would like to consolidate the features of https://github.com/ansible/galaxy and https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng
into the galaxy_ng codebase and bring community usage, contribution and improvements there. In doing so, we want to sunset
the galaxy codebase and cooperatively plan to rehost https://galaxy.ansible.com with an instance of the galaxy_ng codebase.

We do not yet have a timeline for
