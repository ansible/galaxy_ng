# Tip: This can also be passed directly as a compose env argument
#      but in that case every ./compose call must have it
#      e.g:
#        ./compose build -e DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_working_on_pr_123
#        DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_pr_456 ./compose run --rm api manage test
#        ./compose up -e DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_testing
#
# or set here to persist for every ./compose call.
# DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX=""

# Volume suffix can be individually set
# defaults to the same as DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX
# DEV_VOLUME_SUFFIX=${DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX:-}

# Run `wait-for-migrations` script in dev environment.  Defaults to `0` for other environments
# where the script is executed in initContainers.
