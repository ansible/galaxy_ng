# The following two variables were initally specified in the galaxy_ng.env file.
# If you want the same environment for cypress testing as in CI

# otherwise cypress cannot change it.
# PULP_GALAXY_REQUIRE_CONTENT_APPROVAL=false
# PULP_GALAXY_AUTO_SIGN_COLLECTIONS=true

# If you want to run the UI, clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible-hub-ui
# and set this to the path for the UI

# If you want to keep your current running environment but you need
# to build and run a separate env, this variable can set image and volume
# suffix to allow snapshoting of the environments.
#
# Tip: This can also be passed directly as a compose env argument
#      but in that case every ./compose call must have it
#      e.g:
#        ./compose build -e DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_working_on_pr_123
#        DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_pr_456 ./compose run --rm api manage test
#        ./compose up -e DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_testing
#
# or set here to persist for every ./compose call.
# DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX=""

# Volume suffix can be individually set
# defaults to the same as DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX
# DEV_VOLUME_SUFFIX=${DEV_IMAGE_SUFFIX:-}

# Run `wait-for-migrations` script in dev environment.  Defaults to `0` for other environments
# where the script is executed in initContainers. 
WAIT_FOR_MIGRATIONS=1

# Enable setup of signing service in dev environment. Defaults to `0` for other environments
# sharing the same entrypoints.sh
# ATTENTION: THIS IS FOR DEV ENV AND CRC ONLY! DOES NOT AFFECT PRIVATE ENVIRONMENTS.
# 0 = No Signing Service, No Keyring
# 1 = All: Signing Service for collections, Signing Service for containers, Keyring for repos
# 2 = Only keyring for repos (for signature upload verification only scenario)
