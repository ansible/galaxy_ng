    This is a hack to get pulp to associate the model with a viewset.

    This file is necessary to prevent the DRF web API browser from breaking on all of the
    pulp/api/v3/repositories/ endpoints.
    Pulp expects models it manages to come with a viewset attached to them. Since the
    ContainerRegistryRemote model is a pulp remote, pulp expects it to have a NamedModelViewSet
    viewset attached to it. Pulp associates viewsets with models by looking in
    <plugin_name>.app.viewsets. Since galaxy_ng stores its viewsets in a different
    module, this file is necesary for pulp tbe able to associate the ContainerRegistryRemote
    model to a viewset.
    Without this viewset defined here, pulp gets confused when it tries to auto generate
    the form on the repositories endpoint because it tries to provide a dropdown
    on the remote field and can't find a viewset name for galaxy's ContainerRegistryRemote model.
