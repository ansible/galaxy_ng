"""tasks/deletion.py

This module includes tasks related to deleting Content.

You can remove Content from a Repository by making a new RepositoryVersion
without the Content. If an API endpoint uses a Distribution which points to
the latest_version of the Repository then the Content is unavailable,
however it is not deleted.

Content can only be deleted if it exists in no RepositoryVersion.

Content cannot be removed from a RepositoryVersion since it is immutable.

Pulp's orphan_cleanup task deletes any Content not part of a RepositoryVersion.

Deleting Content is made possible by retaining only one RepositoryVersion
for a Repository, and deleting all older RepositoryVersion. This module
assumes retain_repo_versions is set to 1 for all Repository the Content is
associated with.

If retain_repo_versions value has been manually set to greater than 1, than the
CollectionVersion will still exist in previous RepositoryVersion and will
not get deleted from system on orphan_cleanup. In the future if the Content no
longer exists in a RepositoryVersion (they have since been deleted), then the
subsequent orphan_cleanup will delete it from the system.
